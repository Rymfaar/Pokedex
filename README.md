# Pokedex

The Pokedex project is created to learn how to use BLoC and benchmark how effective it is. The main purpose behind it is to create articles about this well-known Flutter architecture. This project uses:

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and Dart to build the app.
* [Pokebuild API](https://pokebuildapi.fr/api/v1) to fetch its data.
* [Buddy](https://buddy.works/) as a CI tool.
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as a design tool. You can find these designs [here](https://www.figma.com/file/2cw87gTgj2aEs9T8ofL1XW/Pokemon-BLoC?node-id=0%3A1&t=7SfsFr8on4V9GeNx-1).
