# Pokedex

## Introduction

### Why this project exists?

The Pokedex project is created to learn how to use BLoC and benchmark how effective it is. The main purpose behind it is to create articles about this well-known Flutter architecture. This project uses:

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and Dart to build the app
* Uses the [Pokebuild API](https://pokebuildapi.fr/api/v1) to fetch its data
* Uses [Buddy](https://buddy.works/) as a CI tool

### What about design?

As the main purpose is not to build a beautiful app, I opted for a simple wireframe design. You can find these designs [here](https://www.figma.com/file/2cw87gTgj2aEs9T8ofL1XW/Pokemon-BLoC?node-id=0%3A1&t=7SfsFr8on4V9GeNx-1), it was made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). 

## How to launch the project?

1. Clone the project
2. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
